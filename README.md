# Photograph

In this project, I use **_HTML5_**, **_SASS_** and **_BEM_**. I use a little bit of **_Vanilla Javascript_** to make the image slider work. Since I work with HTML.

**Styles**:

- I work with Mobile-First by default, and Responsive.
- Use SASS then convert it into CSS

## Prerequisite

- Fork then clone this repository
- Run `npm install`
- You'll want to run the `scss:watch` task when you're developing this project. To do this run `npm run start` or `npm run scss:watch`

- online at [figma.com/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive](https://www.figma.com/file/VgF87mULloYb7HZ1EMCRzU/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive?node-id=0%3A1)

### Source files

Have a look in the `source_materials` folder. There you'll find any fonts you need, images that are required by the design work.
Also, all the images that needed are stored in the `source_materials` folder. Take a copy of them before make any changes.

I use `WOFF/WOFF2` since it is more flexible and more supportive, I use it in fonts rules.
Also, I convert the image into `webp` to make the page load faster.

### Webroot

As with most setups, it's a good idea to isolate all the web-files in the `webroot` folder. Since I don't want to publish everything I stored all things that is needed to be published.

### Sass

I'm using the `scss` folder for all our Sass files.
